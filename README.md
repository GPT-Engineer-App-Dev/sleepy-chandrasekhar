Implement a form to allow uploading a CSV file. The form should have:

- A file input for the CSV file 
- A submit button

When the form is submitted, parse the CSV data and filter the rows to only include those where the "type" column equals "ai_update".

Display the filtered data in a simple HTML table. Include these columns for now:
- id
- commit_sha 
- created_at
- tags

Don't worry about styling yet, just basic HTML elements. I'll add more functionality and styling in future requests.
